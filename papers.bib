Therefore, the loss of connectivity (fragmentation) alters the functioning and diversity patterns of the biota at local and regional scales. The global hydropower boom is one of the main drivers of river network fragmentation, with significant effects on the diversity of riverine biota. Analyses of beta diversity of fish assemblages in rivers with different degrees of fragmentation can give new insights into mechanisms that contribute to the responses of these assemblages to fragmentation.},

  abstract = {Current ecological theories and concepts describe running waters as four-dimensional systems, their longitudinal, lateral and vertical linkages, interactions and exchange processes varying over time and over different scales. According to Ward \& Stanford's (1983) extended serial discontinuity concept (ESDC), along a three-reach river, model the relative strength of the longitudinal pathways is highest in the constrained headwaters, vertical interactions reach their maximum in the braided middle course and lateral connectivity plays the major role in alluvial floodplain rivers. The present paper examines the general tenets of the ESDC from a fundamental fish ecology perspective. Specifically, it focuses on the degree to which the spatial/temporal connectivity requirements of fish communities or key fish species along a schematic longitudinal river course are compatible with the underlying principles of the ESDC and whether these requirements provide basic criteria for assessing the ecological integrity of running waters. From the fish ecological perspective, the examples provided here demonstrate a principle agreement with the concept of the four-dimensional nature of running waters, whose key functional and structural elements are spatial/temporal fluvial dynamics, disturbances, connectivity, succession and ecotones. Fish are particularly useful indicators of the temporally variable connectivities on the full range of scales at the three spatial dimensions. As far as the habitat requirements of typical species/developmental stages are concerned, two major modifications of the ESDC are needed. In constrained headwaters, in addition to longitudinal connectivity, the crucial importance of the vertical pathway river/bed sediments for reproduction must be emphasized. Also, in addition to lateral connectivity, longitudinal connectivity remains a vital basis for potamal fish communities in alluvial braided and meandering zones.},

  abstract = {Techniques for assessing the impact of structural barriers on fish passage and for prioritising restoration actions are reviewed. Current survey methodologies are biased towards specific structures, primarily culverts and economically significant fish. Assessment criteria are often based on swimming capabilities of upstream migrating adult salmonids, while ignoring other life-stages, non-salmonid species, downstream migration and behaviour. The development of comprehensive and centrally owned geospatial inventories of barriers is essential. The collection, maintenance and dissemination of pertinent structural and environmental data can be technically, logistically and financially challenging. Standardised procedures are needed to rapidly and cost-effectively survey large numbers of barriers over wide geographic areas. The prioritisation of barrier repair and removal projects is most often based on simple cost-benefit analysis, whereby individual barriers are scored based on a set of assessment criteria and then ranked in order of priority. The benefits of using scoring-and-ranking systems, however, are unacceptably low because they consider barriers independently, thereby ignoring the cumulative, non-additive impacts produced by multiple, spatially interconnected structures. Optimisation modelling offers a more robust approach for efficiently prioritising decision making in river restoration planning, allowing decision makers to account for key uncertainties and effectively balance multiple, possibly competing, environmental and socioeconomic goals and constraints.},

Improving fish passage at artificial barriers, accordingly, can be an especially effective and economical river restoration option. In this article, we propose a novel, mixed integer programing model for optimizing barrier mitigation decisions given a limited budget. Rather than simply treating barriers as being impassable or not, we consider the more general case in which barriers may be partially passable. Although this assumption normally introduces nonlinearity into the problem, we manage to formulate a linear model via the use of probability chains, a newly proposed technique from the operations research literature. Our model is noteworthy in that it can be readily implemented and solved using off-the-shelf optimization modelling software. Using a case study from the US State of Maine, we demonstrate that the model is highly efficient in comparison with existing solution methods and, moreover, highly scalable in that large problems with many thounsands of barriers can still be solved optimally. Our analysis confirms that barrier mitigation can provide substantial ecological gains for migratory fish at low levels of investment. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, the alignment of DSTs with the objectives in governmental policies or management plans and the influence of limited local data on the outputs of these tools may reduce the use of DSTs by decision makers. In this study, we examined the outcomes of web-based DSTs when different types of local data were incorporated and demonstrated a way to incorporate outputs from multiple DSTs or local inventories to benefit barrier removal decisions. Restoring habitat connectivity in rivers in northwest lower Michigan, USA, was used as a case study due to the abundance of local inventory data and web-based DSTs. We found that, when compared to prioritizations made using local data, some DSTs could produce similar outcomes (in barriers selected, cost, and the benefit for migratory fish) with limited data, but the trade-offs among users' objectives might influence the cost and effectiveness of DSTs' outputs. Improving the ability of DSTs to incorporate objectives consistent with policy and stakeholders' values (e.g., restore certain species or sedimentation control) across management scales can help close the gap between tool recommendations and management decisions while making the barrier removal prioritization process transparent and efficient.},

There is growing momentum in the eastern U.S., and throughout the country, to remove dams which no longer serve their intended purpose, provide improved fish passage facilities at those dams that cannot feasibly be removed, and upgrade road-stream crossings to benefit aquatic organism passage (AOP). However, these projects are expensive and given the extensive scope of the problem and the limited resources available to address it, it is imperative to be strategic in deciding which barriers are removed or upgraded. The Nature Conservancy, in conjunction with several partners, has conducted a suite of analyses which assess and prioritize barriers to AOP for the potential ecological gains that could be realized if they were removed or upgraded. The results of these analyses have been used both proactively and reactively by managers throughout the eastern U.S. to identify potential connectivity restoration projects, support funding requests, and help inform funding allocation decisions by providing a common evaluation system for the many thousands of potential projects. In contrast to more prescriptive barrier removal optimizations, their flexibility of use provides managers with a practical framework for planning aquatic connectivity restoration while remaining open to the element of opportunity.},

We briefly review barrier prioritization methods from the perspective of a policy maker or manager who must balance realities of stochastic opportunities, conflicting priorities, and risk of infrastructure failure. After outlining common motivations for barrier prioritization, we present a menu of techniques ranging from large-scale, quantitative assessments to reactive, local response to failures.

Mantel tests of isolation by distance were significant for anadromous populations (P = 0.007) but not for resident collections (P = 0.061), and suggested that fluvial distance was not the only significant physical variable that influenced genetic structure of life history types. Principal components interpolated to the drainage indicated that high-elevation sites were primarily occupied by the resident form, and high gradients and barriers act to limit anadromous distribution to lower elevation sites. These patterns of O. mykiss life history diversity provide insight regarding the interaction, distribution, and limitations of resident and anadromous forms of the species within this region.

Although small-scale decision making can leverage local expert knowledge, it also may be an inefficient means of achieving large-scale objectives if piecemeal efforts are poorly coordinated. Here, we assess the value of coordinating efforts in both space and time to maximize the restoration of aquatic ecosystem connectivity. Habitat fragmentation is a leading driver of declining biodiversity and ecosystem services in rivers worldwide, and we simultaneously evaluate optimal barrier removal strategies for 661 tributary rivers of the Laurentian Great Lakes, which are fragmented by at least 6,692 dams and 232,068 road crossings. We find that coordinating barrier removals across the entire basin is nine times more efficient at reconnecting fish to headwater breeding grounds than optimizing independently for each watershed. Similarly, a one-time pulse of restoration investment is up to 10 times more efficient than annual allocations totaling the same amount. Despite widespread emphasis on dams as key barriers in river networks, improving road culvert passability is also essential for efficiently restoring connectivity to the Great Lakes. Our results highlight the dramatic economic and ecological advantages of coordinating efforts in both space and time during restoration of large ecosystems.},

Of 22 radiotagged fish, 16 migrated during the spawning period (mean length, 371 mm). Ten of the 22 fish were tracked over a 2-year period, and 2 of these fish migrated in both 1997 and 1998. Migrations to tributaries occurred during the rising limb of the hydrograph in both years and lasted for an average of 10 d (range, 1\textendash 14 d) in 1998. Migratory fish moved both upriver and downriver to reach spawning tributaries during both years. In 1998 the mean distance traveled to access tributaries was 31 km (range, 3\textendash 72 km). Fish staged at the mouths of tributaries for up to 14 d before entering near the peak in the hydrograph. They remained in tributaries for an average of 27 d (range, 4\textendash 63 d), the duration varying with size of tributary and flow year. Once in tributaries, fish generally remained within a 200-m reach, but frequently moved within the area. In four tributaries to the Blackfoot River, actively spawning fish were observed in May 1998 as flows subsided after the peak discharge. Neither of the two repeat migrants spawned within 3 km of their previous year's spawning location, though both spawned in the same tributaries. After leaving tributaries, fish moved both up- and downriver to overwintering areas and did not move more than 100 m thereafter. Fish did not exhibit fidelity to their prespawning main-stem locations. At least six fish died after spawning (38\%). Westslope cutthroat trout movements, prespawning and postspawning, exhibited a plasticity not previously reported in Montana and demonstrate the large spatial extent to which fluvial westslope cutthroat trout utilize aquatic resources. To enable continued improvement of the westslope cutthroat trout population in the Blackfoot River drainage, I recommend riparian timber management that continues long-term input of large woody debris to tributaries, continued closure of the Blackfoot River watershed to angling harvest, and the use of culvert designs that will pass spawning fish under most flow conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract The serial discontinuity concept (SDC) was developed as a theoretical construct that views impoundments as major disruptions of longitudinal resource gradients along river courses. According to the SDC, dams result in upstream?downstream shifts in biotic and abiotic patterns and processes; the direction and extent of the displacement depend on the variable of interest and are a function of dam position along the river continuum. As originally formulated, the SDC did not consider interactions between the river and its flood plain. The new perspective presented herein is an initial attempt to encompass the dynamics of alluvial flood plain rivers into the model using a three reach characterization: constrained headwater reach, braided reach and meandering reach. The constrained headwater reach has conditions similar to those described in the original SDC, but the braided and meandering reaches provide a perspective that was not addressed in the model. Lateral interactions between the channel and the flood plain are critical to a holistic understanding of natural river ecosystems and the alterations induced by regulation. The fringing flood plain, with its diverse water bodies and alluvial forest mosaic, is considered an integral part of the river system.},
