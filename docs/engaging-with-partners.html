<div id="methods-of-engagement" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Methods of engagement</h3>
<p>The methods of engagement should be tailored to meet the needs of local partners, and may include one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual or group telephone or videoconference calls</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>In-person meetings with individual partners or groups of partners</li>
</ul>
<p>If the primary geographic scope of a WCRP covers a large area, any in-person meetings should be held in a central location or across several different locations to ensure that as many partners as possible have an opportunity to attend. There may also be temporal considerations when engaging with partners; telephone calls and virtual meetings should account for the different time zones in which partners may be located. Engagement methods may change over time, both in response to seasonal changes, such as when partners are busy with field work during in-stream work windows, or during unforeseen circumstances, such as the onset of COVID-19. Remain flexible and accommodate the needs of each partner.</p>
</div>
<div id="partner-profiles" class="section level3" number="2.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Partner profiles</h3>
<p>Creating a profile for each partner provides an opportunity to document any important information about their potential involvement in the WCRP, as well as to track any key issues, concerns, or questions that are raised by the partner. Having an internal system for following up on important items that were raised is critical to provide clarity, build trust, and streamline communication during future engagement. Profiles provide a detailed summary for partners who agreed to actively participate in the planning process. Profiles should be updated throughout the planning process as new information becomes available over time. A partner profile template is available in Appendix C.</p>
</div>
<div id="building-trust" class="section level3" number="2.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Building trust</h3>
<p>Building trust is an essential prerequisite for meaningful partner engagement, as is a commitment to deepening that level of trust. Investing time to understand the motivations and concerns of partners can lead to strong, open, and receptive relationships where misunderstandings are reduced. Leading with empathy and striving to find solutions that benefit all partners are both key to building trust and team cohesion. Being transparent about the status of the planning process and development of the WCRP, and keeping partners apprised of progress, setbacks, and shifting timelines and priorities, is also key to building a culture of trust. This should include directly communicating any issues or concerns that are brought forward and asking partners for help and advice when needed. When building trust, only make commitments if they can be fulfilled.</p>
</div>
<div id="obstacles-to-engagement" class="section level3" number="2.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Obstacles to engagement</h3>
<p>Recognizing and addressing obstacles to partner engagement can help to achieve equitable participation when developing the WCRP. Obstacles to engagement may vary depending on a variety of socioeconomic factors (see Table <a href="engaging-with-partners.html#tab:tab6">2.3</a>). Developing solutions that work toward reducing these barriers will help to increase engagement in the WCRP.</p>

<div id="frequency-of-engagement-and-techniques" class="section level3" number="2.3.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Frequency of engagement and techniques</h3>
<p>WCRP coordinators should proactively determine the frequency of engagement based on the level of participation of each partner’s choosing. For example, partners may prefer longer intervals between communications, regular engagement, or a single multi-day workshop. Partners that are leading or contributing should be engaged regularly and included in all important communications, whereas those that wish to receive updates may prefer to be contacted when important milestones have been reached. Effective engagement may require several separate events using a variety of techniques at different points throughout the planning process (see Table <a href="engaging-with-partners.html#tab:tab7">2.4</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.6</span> Core principles for effective engagement</h3>
<p>Developing and following a set of core principles (see Table <a href="engaging-with-partners.html#tab:tab8">2.5</a>) for effective engagement with partners should be a continuous process. Effective engagement is essential to ensure the successful development and implementation of a WCRP because the planning process necessitates that local partners actively contribute to establishing goals to improve the connectivity status of the watershed and identifying strategies and actions that will be undertaken locally to achieve on-the-ground gains in connectivity (see Section 3.7). Additionally, a significant component of WCRP implementation requires field work to assess barriers, confirm habitat, and remediate barriers and will occur on the traditional territory of Indigenous groups or privately owned land in the watershed. Ensuring that partner engagement is undertaken respectfully and effectively will help to facilitate the necessary collaborations and permissions that are required to undertake this field work. A good set of core principles should be flexible to incorporate feedback from partners and adapt to shifting needs and priorities.</p>

All partners are provided an opportunity to engage regardless of gender, race, age, class, sexual orientation, education, or religion
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Equitable representation
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Partners that belong to minority groups or have less power and influence in the watershed have equal opportunity to contribute to the planning process (Volger, Macey, and Sigouin 2017).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Engagement is continual
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Engagement is ongoing and iterative and will start as early as possible in the planning process. Partners will not feel abandoned by the WCRP coordinators.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Engagement is culturally sensitive
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The organization is aware that the outcomes of a WCRP may affect groups differently. These may include social, cultural, and spiritual effects.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Indigenous Traditional Knowledge is respected
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The organization shares Indigenous knowledge in an appropriate or accepted way. This may involve following the OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access and Possession) principles and negotiating knowledge and data-sharing agreements (see Section 4.1.3).
</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Recognize trade-offs
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Recognizing trade-offs acknowledges that partners might not achieve all their desired outcomes from a WCRP.
</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Local goalsetting
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Conservation goals usually define tradeoffs between ecological and socioeconomic priorities. They are not objective, or quantitatively derived. As such, they must be made by local stakeholders and rightsholders who live with the outcomes of such tradeoffs.
