<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 3</span> Partner Engagement</h1>
<p>Once the WCRP is conceptualized and funding is secured, the next step is to develop an effective process for engaging stakeholders and rightsholders. The term “stakeholder” refers to any individual or group that has an interest in freshwater connectivity within the projects’ primary geographic scope. Examples may include federal, provincial, or local governments, non-governmental organizations, academics, natural resource companies, and local environmental groups, among others. The term “rightsholder” refers to Indigenous peoples with traditional territory that coincides with the primary geographic scope. Indigenous peoples have an internationally recognized right to support or oppose activities that occur within their traditional territory, and as such, distinguishing between stakeholders and rightsholders is critically important to avoid conflating the distinct rights of Indigenous peoples with the interests of other groups. Meaningful engagement with stakeholders and rightsholders (hereafter called “partner engagement”) is essential when undertaking a partner-based strategic planning process such as a WCRP, given that success is ultimately dependent on building relationships, fostering collaboration, and maintaining strong team cohesion throughout the lifespan of the plan. To achieve this requires two-way communication and knowledge sharing, as well as a sincere desire to understand and integrate the spectrum of stakeholder and rightsholder views, interests, and values into the WCRP.</p>
<div id="engage-plan" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Planning for Partner Engagement</h2>
<p>Partner engagement provides an opportunity for all stakeholders and rightsholders to be informed and involved throughout the strategic planning process, while also providing important contributions toward the development of the WCRP. It allows those who may affect, be affected by, or have an interest in the outcomes of a WCRP to collectively pool knowledge, experience, and expertise to co-create solutions to important connectivity challenges in the watershed. Partner engagement can help build productive and collaborative relationships and improve communication channels. Listening to multiple perspectives throughout the planning process enables organizations to better address criticisms and concerns, effectively solve problems, and ultimately ensure that there is clarity of purpose and a shared vision for the future.</p>
<p>Engagement can also help to determine the level of interest and support that exists for developing a WCRP in the watershed. Partners often have firsthand information about current or past conservation work in the watershed and the types of knowledge and data needed for development of the WCRP. Upon completion of the WCRP, some partners in the watershed may choose to take ownership of the plan or contribute to specific components of the plan’s implementation. Overall, engagement should help to align the WCRP with the conservation goals and priorities of the local communities in the watershed.</p>
<div id="defining-the-purpose-of-initial-engagement" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Defining the purpose of initial engagement</h3>
<p>Before any engagement occurs, first identify what you aim to achieve during initial partner engagement, such as an introduction to the coordinating organization, requesting permission to work in a specific geographic area, gauging the level of familiarity and support for the proposed work, providing information about the planning process, or requesting participation in developing the WCRP. Regardless of the aim, initial engagement should begin early so that WCRP coordinators can flag any potential issues that may affect the planning process. Some important questions to consider when defining the purpose of initial engagement are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the potential partner familiar with my organization or the WCRP process?</li>
<li>What do I want to learn about this potential partner?</li>
<li>What are the key freshwater conservation issues to be discussed during this conversation?</li>
<li>Are potential partners being asked to contribute time or other resources?</li>
<li>Are resources available to support their involvement in the WCRP process?</li>
<li>Does the potential partner have past experience working with conservation organizations? If so, were those experiences positive or negative?</li>
<li>Are there important timeframes to consider for initial engagement?</li>
<li>Are there legal obligations to consider for engagement?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="core-values-for-participation" class="section level3" number="3.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Core values for participation</h3>
<p>The core values for participation are guiding principles that influence how partners will participate in various stages of the WCRP process. Developing a set of core values like those presented in Table <a href="engagement.html#tab:tab4">3.1</a> will not only help strengthen the engagement process, but also help communicate expectations on how the WCRP process will unfold over time.</p>

<div id="developing-a-partner-register" class="section level3" number="3.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Developing a partner register</h3>
<p>Identifying and creating a register of potential partners is the next step in the engagement process. The register should comprise a preliminary list of all partners with interest, activities, or traditional territory in the watershed. It should identify key individuals and their role within their respective group or organization, contact details, and any additional information that may be relevant to the engagement process. Once engagement commences, the register can be used to track contact attempts, including date(s) and method(s) of engagement. When working with numerous partners, this can help streamline the engagement process and provide a basis to gauge if or when subsequent engagement attempts should be made. The register should also be updated as partners identify other groups and organizations to engage in the WCRP process over time. An example of a partner register is available in Appendix B.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Methods of engagement</h3>
<p>The methods of engagement should be tailored to meet the needs of local partners, and may include one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual or group telephone or videoconference calls</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>In-person meetings with individual partners or groups of partners</li>
</ul>
<p>If the primary geographic scope of a WCRP covers a large area, any in-person meetings should be held in a central location or across several different locations to ensure that as many partners as possible have an opportunity to attend. There may also be temporal considerations when engaging with partners; telephone calls and virtual meetings should account for the different time zones in which partners may be located. Engagement methods may change over time, both in response to seasonal changes, such as when partners are busy with field work during in-stream work windows, or during unforeseen circumstances, such as the onset of COVID-19. Remain flexible and accommodate the needs of each partner.</p>

<p>Creating a profile for each partner provides an opportunity to document any important information about their potential involvement in the WCRP, as well as to track any key issues, concerns, or questions that are raised by the partner. Having an internal system for following up on important items that were raised is critical to provide clarity, build trust, and streamline communication during future engagement. Profiles provide a detailed summary for partners who agreed to actively participate in the planning process. Profiles should be updated throughout the planning process as new information becomes available over time. A partner profile template is available in Appendix C.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Building trust</h3>
<p>Building trust is an essential prerequisite for meaningful partner engagement, as is a commitment to deepening that level of trust. Investing time to understand the motivations and concerns of partners can lead to strong, open, and receptive relationships where misunderstandings are reduced. Leading with empathy and striving to find solutions that benefit all partners are both key to building trust and team cohesion. Being transparent about the status of the planning process and development of the WCRP, and keeping partners apprised of progress, setbacks, and shifting timelines and priorities, is also key to building a culture of trust. This should include directly communicating any issues or concerns that are brought forward and asking partners for help and advice when needed. When building trust, only make commitments if they can be fulfilled.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5</span> Frequency of engagement and techniques</h3>
<p>WCRP coordinators should proactively determine the frequency of engagement based on the level of participation of each partner’s choosing. For example, partners may prefer longer intervals between communications, regular engagement, or a single multi-day workshop. Partners that are leading or contributing should be engaged regularly and included in all important communications, whereas those that wish to receive updates may prefer to be contacted when important milestones have been reached. Effective engagement may require several separate events using a variety of techniques at different points throughout the planning process (see Table <a href="engagement.html#tab:tab7">3.4</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.6</span> Core principles for effective engagement</h3>
<p>Developing and following a set of core principles (see Table <a href="engagement.html#tab:tab8">3.5</a>) for effective engagement with partners should be a continuous process. Effective engagement is essential to ensure the successful development and implementation of a WCRP because the planning process necessitates that local partners actively contribute to establishing goals to improve the connectivity status of the watershed and identifying strategies and actions that will be undertaken locally to achieve on-the-ground gains in connectivity (see Section 3.7). Additionally, a significant component of WCRP implementation requires field work to assess barriers, confirm habitat, and remediate barriers and will occur on the traditional territory of Indigenous groups or privately owned land in the watershed. Ensuring that partner engagement is undertaken respectfully and effectively will help to facilitate the necessary collaborations and permissions that are required to undertake this field work. A good set of core principles should be flexible to incorporate feedback from partners and adapt to shifting needs and priorities.</p>

Two-way communication
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Both sides can exchange views and information, and have their questions and concerns addressed.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Transparent information
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Available information and analysis are transparent and contextualized to provide partners with a holistic image of the planning process.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Inclusive representation
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
All partners are provided an opportunity to engage regardless of gender, race, age, class, sexual orientation, education, or religion
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Equitable representation
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Partners that belong to minority groups or have less power and influence in the watershed have equal opportunity to contribute to the planning process (Volger, Macey, and Sigouin 2017).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Engagement is continual
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Engagement is ongoing and iterative and will start as early as possible in the planning process. Partners will not feel abandoned by the WCRP coordinators.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Engagement is culturally sensitive
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The organization is aware that the outcomes of a WCRP may affect groups differently. These may include social, cultural, and spiritual effects.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Indigenous Traditional Knowledge is respected
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The organization shares Indigenous knowledge in an appropriate or accepted way. This may involve following the OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access and Possession) principles and negotiating knowledge and data-sharing agreements (see Section 4.1.3).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Recognize trade-offs
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Recognizing trade-offs acknowledges that partners might not achieve all their desired outcomes from a WCRP.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Local goalsetting
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Conservation goals usually define tradeoffs between ecological and socioeconomic priorities. They are not objective, or quantitatively derived. As such, they must be made by local stakeholders and rightsholders who live with the outcomes of such tradeoffs.
