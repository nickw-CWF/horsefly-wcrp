Connectivity Dimension,Description
Longitudinal,"Connectivity of a stream along the upstream-downstream plane (Figure 1), including access to tributaries and spawning and rearing habitat. Longitudinal connectivity can be fragmented by physical barriers (e.g., anthropogenic or natural structures) or by physiological limits of distribution for species (e.g., stream gradient, temperature, or flow requirements)."
Lateral,"Connectivity of a stream bed to adjacent riparian wetlands and floodplains (Figure 1), including access to rearing and overwintering habitat. Lateral connectivity can be fragmented by physical barriers, channelization, armouring of the stream bed, or artificial flow regulation."
Vertical,"Connectivity of a stream bed to groundwater/hyporheic zone (Figure 1), including access to oxygen-rich temperature refugia. Vertical connectivity can be fragmented by water withdrawals and anthropogenically induced changes to the hydrological, thermal, and sediment regimes of the watershed."
Temporal,"Connectivity variability in any of the three spatial dimensions based on temporal changes in the natural flow regime. Variation in temporal connectivity occurs naturally; however, fragmentation can be exacerbated through anthropogenically induced changes to the hydrological, thermal, and sediment regimes of the watershed."
