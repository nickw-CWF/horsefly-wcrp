Principle,Description
Two-way communication,"Both sides can exchange views and information, and have their questions and concerns addressed."
Transparent information,Available information and analysis are transparent and contextualized to provide partners with a holistic image of the planning process.
Inclusive representation,"All partners are provided an opportunity to engage regardless of gender, race, age, class, sexual orientation, education, or religion"
Equitable representation,"Partners that belong to minority groups or have less power and influence in the watershed have equal opportunity to contribute to the planning process (Volger, Macey, and Sigouin 2017)."
Engagement is continual,Engagement is ongoing and iterative and will start as early as possible in the planning process. Partners will not feel abandoned by the WCRP coordinators.
Engagement is culturally sensitive,"The organization is aware that the outcomes of a WCRP may affect groups differently. These may include social, cultural, and spiritual effects."
Indigenous Traditional Knowledge is respected,"The organization shares Indigenous knowledge in an appropriate or accepted way. This may involve following the OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access and Possession) principles and negotiating knowledge and data-sharing agreements (see Section 4.1.3)."
Recognize trade-offs,Recognizing trade-offs acknowledges that partners might not achieve all their desired outcomes from a WCRP.
Local goalsetting,"Conservation goals usually define tradeoffs between ecological and socioeconomic priorities.  They are not objective, or quantitatively derived.  As such, they must be made by local stakeholders and rightsholders who live with the outcomes of such tradeoffs."
