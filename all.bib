  abstract = {Spatial structure regulates and modifies processes at several levels of ecological organization (e.g. individual/genetic, population and community) and is thus a key component of complex systems, where knowledge at a small scale can be insufficient for understanding system behaviour at a larger scale. Recent syntheses outline potential applications of network theory to ecological systems, but do not address the implications of physical structure for network dynamics. There is a specific need to examine how dendritic habitat structure, such as that found in stream, hedgerow and cave networks, influences ecological processes. Although dendritic networks are one type of ecological network, they are distinguished by two fundamental characteristics: (1) both the branches and the nodes serve as habitat, and (2) the specific spatial arrangement and hierarchical organization of these elements interacts with a species\~O movement behaviour to alter patterns of population distribution and abundance, and community interactions. Here, we summarize existing theory relating to ecological dynamics in dendritic networks, review empirical studies examining the population- and community-level consequences of these networks, and suggest future research integrating spatial pattern and processes in dendritic systems.},

  abstract = {Road crossings can act as barriers to the movement of stream fishes, resulting in habitat fragmentation, reduced population resilience to environmental disturbance and higher risks of extinction. Strategic barrier removal has the potential to improve connectivity in stream networks, but managers lack a consistent framework for determining which projects will most benefit target species. The objective of this study is to develop a method for identifying and prioritizing action on road crossings in order to restore stream network connectivity. We demonstrate the method using a case study from the Pine-Popple watershed in Wisconsin. First, we propose a new metric for quantifying stream connectivity status for stream-resident fish. The metric quantifies the individual and cumulative effects of barriers on reach and watershed level connectivity, while accounting for natural barriers, distance-based dispersal limitations and variation in habitat type and quality. We conducted a comprehensive field survey of road crossings in the watershed to identify barriers and estimate replacement costs. Of the 190 surveyed road crossings, 74\% were determined to be barriers to the movement of at least one species or life stage of fish, primarily due to high water velocity, low water depth or outlet drops. The results of the barrier removal prioritization show that initial projects targeted for mitigation create much greater improvements in connectivity per unit cost than later projects. Benefit\textendash cost curves from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate potential projects within and among watersheds and minimize overall expenditures for specified restoration targets.

  abstract = {River restoration through dam removal provides an opportunity to investigate the changing nature of environmental conflicts and politics in long-humanized landscapes. In New England, where over 14,000 dams fragment the region's rivers, dam removals are often highly contested. This is due, in part, to how the intertwined roles of history, identity, and aesthetics coalesce to create attachment to place and inspire the defense of dammed landscapes. Dam removal provides a useful lens to consider the following: How do the historical and geographical contingencies of this region shape and alter conflicts over dam removal in specific ways? In instances where conflicts emerge, what do the conflicts reveal about the politics of ecological restoration in highly altered landscapes? We use a political ecology approach to reveal how complex cultural dynamics, competing interpretations of science and the environment, micropolitics, and the role of multiple actors generate and shape conflicts over dam removal. We show that the historical geography of New England influence conflicts over removal in important ways, particularly with regard to the roles of aesthetics and identity in landscapes that are characterized largely by consumptive as opposed to productive uses. Our findings also suggest that restoration in long-humanized landscapes will embroil new constellations of human and nonhuman actors, requiring attention to the political and cultural, as well as the ecological, dimensions of restoration. This paper contributes to research on the political and social dimensions of dam removal, as well as to research at the nexus of ecological restoration and environmental politics.},

  abstract = {Current ecological theories and concepts describe running waters as four-dimensional systems, their longitudinal, lateral and vertical linkages, interactions and exchange processes varying over time and over different scales. According to Ward \& Stanford's (1983) extended serial discontinuity concept (ESDC), along a three-reach river, model the relative strength of the longitudinal pathways is highest in the constrained headwaters, vertical interactions reach their maximum in the braided middle course and lateral connectivity plays the major role in alluvial floodplain rivers. The present paper examines the general tenets of the ESDC from a fundamental fish ecology perspective. Specifically, it focuses on the degree to which the spatial/temporal connectivity requirements of fish communities or key fish species along a schematic longitudinal river course are compatible with the underlying principles of the ESDC and whether these requirements provide basic criteria for assessing the ecological integrity of running waters. From the fish ecological perspective, the examples provided here demonstrate a principle agreement with the concept of the four-dimensional nature of running waters, whose key functional and structural elements are spatial/temporal fluvial dynamics, disturbances, connectivity, succession and ecotones. Fish are particularly useful indicators of the temporally variable connectivities on the full range of scales at the three spatial dimensions. As far as the habitat requirements of typical species/developmental stages are concerned, two major modifications of the ESDC are needed. In constrained headwaters, in addition to longitudinal connectivity, the crucial importance of the vertical pathway river/bed sediments for reproduction must be emphasized. Also, in addition to lateral connectivity, longitudinal connectivity remains a vital basis for potamal fish communities in alluvial braided and meandering zones.},

  abstract = {Techniques for assessing the impact of structural barriers on fish passage and for prioritising restoration actions are reviewed. Current survey methodologies are biased towards specific structures, primarily culverts and economically significant fish. Assessment criteria are often based on swimming capabilities of upstream migrating adult salmonids, while ignoring other life-stages, non-salmonid species, downstream migration and behaviour. The development of comprehensive and centrally owned geospatial inventories of barriers is essential. The collection, maintenance and dissemination of pertinent structural and environmental data can be technically, logistically and financially challenging. Standardised procedures are needed to rapidly and cost-effectively survey large numbers of barriers over wide geographic areas. The prioritisation of barrier repair and removal projects is most often based on simple cost-benefit analysis, whereby individual barriers are scored based on a set of assessment criteria and then ranked in order of priority. The benefits of using scoring-and-ranking systems, however, are unacceptably low because they consider barriers independently, thereby ignoring the cumulative, non-additive impacts produced by multiple, spatially interconnected structures. Optimisation modelling offers a more robust approach for efficiently prioritising decision making in river restoration planning, allowing decision makers to account for key uncertainties and effectively balance multiple, possibly competing, environmental and socioeconomic goals and constraints.},

Improving fish passage at artificial barriers, accordingly, can be an especially effective and economical river restoration option. In this article, we propose a novel, mixed integer programing model for optimizing barrier mitigation decisions given a limited budget. Rather than simply treating barriers as being impassable or not, we consider the more general case in which barriers may be partially passable. Although this assumption normally introduces nonlinearity into the problem, we manage to formulate a linear model via the use of probability chains, a newly proposed technique from the operations research literature. Our model is noteworthy in that it can be readily implemented and solved using off-the-shelf optimization modelling software. Using a case study from the US State of Maine, we demonstrate that the model is highly efficient in comparison with existing solution methods and, moreover, highly scalable in that large problems with many thounsands of barriers can still be solved optimally. Our analysis confirms that barrier mitigation can provide substantial ecological gains for migratory fish at low levels of investment. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this study, we examined the outcomes of web-based DSTs when different types of local data were incorporated and demonstrated a way to incorporate outputs from multiple DSTs or local inventories to benefit barrier removal decisions. Restoring habitat connectivity in rivers in northwest lower Michigan, USA, was used as a case study due to the abundance of local inventory data and web-based DSTs. We found that, when compared to prioritizations made using local data, some DSTs could produce similar outcomes (in barriers selected, cost, and the benefit for migratory fish) with limited data, but the trade-offs among users' objectives might influence the cost and effectiveness of DSTs' outputs. Improving the ability of DSTs to incorporate objectives consistent with policy and stakeholders' values (e.g., restore certain species or sedimentation control) across management scales can help close the gap between tool recommendations and management decisions while making the barrier removal prioritization process transparent and efficient.},

There is growing momentum in the eastern U.S., and throughout the country, to remove dams which no longer serve their intended purpose, provide improved fish passage facilities at those dams that cannot feasibly be removed, and upgrade road-stream crossings to benefit aquatic organism passage (AOP). However, these projects are expensive and given the extensive scope of the problem and the limited resources available to address it, it is imperative to be strategic in deciding which barriers are removed or upgraded. The Nature Conservancy, in conjunction with several partners, has conducted a suite of analyses which assess and prioritize barriers to AOP for the potential ecological gains that could be realized if they were removed or upgraded. The results of these analyses have been used both proactively and reactively by managers throughout the eastern U.S. to identify potential connectivity restoration projects, support funding requests, and help inform funding allocation decisions by providing a common evaluation system for the many thousands of potential projects. In contrast to more prescriptive barrier removal optimizations, their flexibility of use provides managers with a practical framework for planning aquatic connectivity restoration while remaining open to the element of opportunity.},

Trade-offs associated with these competing costs and benefits occur globally, with applications in barrier addition (e.g. dam and road construction), reengineering (e.g. culvert repair), and removal (e.g. dam removal and aging infrastructure). Barrier prioritization provides a unique opportunity to: (i) restore and reconnect potentially large habitat patches quickly and effectively and (ii) avoid impacts prior to occurrence in line with the mitigation hierarchy (i.e. avoid then minimize then mitigate). This paper synthesizes 46 watershed-scale barrier planning studies and presents a procedure to guide barrier prioritization associated with connectivity for aquatic organisms. We focus on practical issues informing prioritization studies such as available data sets, methods, techniques, and tools.

  abstract = {Landscape features can significantly influence genetic and life history diversity of rainbow/steelhead trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. In this study, heterozygosity of 21 populations of O. mykiss from the Pacific Northwest, USA, was significantly negatively correlated with features such as elevation (P = 0.0023), upstream distance (P = 0.0129), and precipitation (P = 0.0331), and positively correlated with temperature (P = 0.0123). Mantel tests of isolation by distance were significant for anadromous populations (P = 0.007) but not for resident collections (P = 0.061), and suggested that fluvial distance was not the only significant physical variable that influenced genetic structure of life history types. Principal components interpolated to the drainage indicated that high-elevation sites were primarily occupied by the resident form, and high gradients and barriers act to limit anadromous distribution to lower elevation sites. These patterns of O. mykiss life history diversity provide insight regarding the interaction, distribution, and limitations of resident and anadromous forms of the species within this region.

Although small-scale decision making can leverage local expert knowledge, it also may be an inefficient means of achieving large-scale objectives if piecemeal efforts are poorly coordinated. Here, we assess the value of coordinating efforts in both space and time to maximize the restoration of aquatic ecosystem connectivity. Habitat fragmentation is a leading driver of declining biodiversity and ecosystem services in rivers worldwide, and we simultaneously evaluate optimal barrier removal strategies for 661 tributary rivers of the Laurentian Great Lakes, which are fragmented by at least 6,692 dams and 232,068 road crossings. We find that coordinating barrier removals across the entire basin is nine times more efficient at reconnecting fish to headwater breeding grounds than optimizing independently for each watershed. Similarly, a one-time pulse of restoration investment is up to 10 times more efficient than annual allocations totaling the same amount. Despite widespread emphasis on dams as key barriers in river networks, improving road culvert passability is also essential for efficiently restoring connectivity to the Great Lakes. Our results highlight the dramatic economic and ecological advantages of coordinating efforts in both space and time during restoration of large ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) are a unique form of ecological networks that exhibit a dendritic network topology (e.g. stream and cave networks or plant architecture). DENs have a dual spatial representation; as points within the network and as points in geographical space. Consequently, some analytical methods used to quantify relationships in other types of ecological networks, or in 2-D space, may be inadequate for studying the influence of structure and connectivity on ecological processes within DENs. We propose a conceptual taxonomy of network analysis methods that account for DEN characteristics to varying degrees and provide a synthesis of the different approaches within the context of stream ecology. Within this context, we summarise the key innovations of a new family of spatial statistical models that describe spatial relationships in DENs. Finally, we discuss how different network analyses may be combined to address more complex and novel research questions. While our main focus is streams, the taxonomy of network analyses is also relevant anywhere spatial patterns in both network and 2-D space can be used to explore the influence of multi-scale processes on biota and their habitat (e.g. plant morphology and pest infestation, or preferential migration along stream or road corridors).},

  abstract = {Disruption of movement patterns due to alterations in habitat connectivity is a pervasive effect of humans on animal populations. In many terrestrial and aquatic systems, there is increasing tension between the need to simultaneously allow passage of some species while blocking the passage of other species. We explore the ecological basis for selective fragmentation of riverine systems where the need to restrict movements of invasive species conflicts with the need to allow passage of species of commercial, recreational, or conservation concern. We develop a trait-based framework for selective fish passage based on understanding the types of movements displayed by fishes and the role of ecological filters in determining the spatial distributions of fishes. We then synthesize information on trait-based mechanisms involved with these filters to create a multidimensional niche space based on attributes such as physical capabilities, body morphology, sensory capabilities, behavior, and movement phenology. Following this, we review how these mechanisms have been applied to achieve selective fish passage across anthropogenic barriers. To date, trap-and-sort or capture-translocation efforts provide the best options for movement filters that are completely species selective, but these methods are hampered by the continual, high cost of manual sorting. Other less effective methods of selective passage risk collateral damage in the form of lower or higher than desired levels of passage. Fruitful areas for future work include using combinations of ecological and behavioral traits to passively segregate species; using taxon-specific chemical or auditory cues to direct unwanted species away from passageways and into physical or ecological traps while attracting desirable species to passageways; and developing automated sorting mechanisms based on fish recognition systems. The trait-based approach proposed for fish could serve as a template for selective fragmentation in other ecological systems.},

Both cutthroat and coho occurred at their highest densities in very small streams ({$<$} 5 m channel width), and bankfull channel width was the single best predictor of cutthroat presence (p = 0.0001) and density (R 2 = 0.55). Within a channel, densities of coho and larger (yearling and older) cutthroat parr were highest in pools, while densities of young-of-the-year cutthroat were significantly lower in pools and highest in shallower habitats. Abundance of larger cutthroat parr and pool habitat were positively correlated with large woody debris (LWD) within a subset of intermediate-gradient gravel\textendash cobble streams, where pools appear to be limiting to larger cutthroat parr abundance. More than 50\% of pools were formed by scour associated with LWD in streams ranging from 1.2 to 11 m channel width, and pools formed by LWD scour were on average 10\% deeper than pools formed by other mechanisms. Disproportionate use of small streams by cutthroat indicates that protection of small stream habitat is important for long-term conservation of sea-run populations.},

  abstract = {I studied the seasonal movements and habitat use of fluvial westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi from 1997 to 1999 in the Blackfoot River drainage in western Montana to help guide restoration efforts and lead to a better understanding of this subspecies. Of 22 radiotagged fish, 16 migrated during the spawning period (mean length, 371 mm). Ten of the 22 fish were tracked over a 2-year period, and 2 of these fish migrated in both 1997 and 1998. Migrations to tributaries occurred during the rising limb of the hydrograph in both years and lasted for an average of 10 d (range, 1\textendash 14 d) in 1998. Migratory fish moved both upriver and downriver to reach spawning tributaries during both years. In 1998 the mean distance traveled to access tributaries was 31 km (range, 3\textendash 72 km). Fish staged at the mouths of tributaries for up to 14 d before entering near the peak in the hydrograph. They remained in tributaries for an average of 27 d (range, 4\textendash 63 d), the duration varying with size of tributary and flow year. Once in tributaries, fish generally remained within a 200-m reach, but frequently moved within the area. In four tributaries to the Blackfoot River, actively spawning fish were observed in May 1998 as flows subsided after the peak discharge. Neither of the two repeat migrants spawned within 3 km of their previous year's spawning location, though both spawned in the same tributaries. After leaving tributaries, fish moved both up- and downriver to overwintering areas and did not move more than 100 m thereafter. Fish did not exhibit fidelity to their prespawning main-stem locations. At least six fish died after spawning (38\%). Westslope cutthroat trout movements, prespawning and postspawning, exhibited a plasticity not previously reported in Montana and demonstrate the large spatial extent to which fluvial westslope cutthroat trout utilize aquatic resources. To enable continued improvement of the westslope cutthroat trout population in the Blackfoot River drainage, I recommend riparian timber management that continues long-term input of large woody debris to tributaries, continued closure of the Blackfoot River watershed to angling harvest, and the use of culvert designs that will pass spawning fish under most flow conditions.},

The IP model focuses on geomorphic conditions that lead to the development of a habitat that fish use and includes three geomorphic channel parameters: confinement, width and gradient. We found that the amount of potential habitat for each population does not correlate with current, depressed, total population abundance. However, reaches currently used by spawners have high IP, and IP model results correlate well with results from the complex Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment model. A disproportionately large amount of habitat with the best potential is currently inaccessible to fish because of anthropogenic barriers. Sensitivity analyses indicate that uncertainty in the relationship between channel width and habitat suitability has the largest influence on model results and that model form influences model results more for some populations than for others.

  abstract = {Large portions of watersheds and streams are lost to anadromous fishes because of anthropogenic barriers to migration. The loss of these streams and rivers has shifted the distribution of accessible habitat, often reducing the diversity of accessible habitat and the quantity of high-quality habitat. We combined existing inventories of barriers to adult fish passage in the Willamette and Lower Columbia River basins and identified 1,491 anthropogenic barriers to fish passage blocking 14,931 km of streams. We quantified and compared the stream quality, land cover, and physical characteristics of lost versus currently accessible habitat by watershed, assessed the effect of barriers on the variability of accessible habitats, and investigated potential impacts of habitat reduction on endangered or threatened salmonid populations. The majority of the study watersheds have lost more than 40\% of total fish stream habitat. Overall, 40\% of the streams with spawning gradients suitable for steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss), 60\% of streams with riparian habitat in good condition, and 30\% of streams draining watersheds with all coniferous land cover are no longer accessible to anadromous fish. Across watersheds, hydrologic and topographic watershed characteristics were correlated with barrier location, barrier density, and the impacts of barriers on habitat. Population-based abundance scores for spring Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were strongly correlated with the magnitude of habitat lost and the number of lowland fish passage barriers. The characteristics of barrier and habitat distribution presented in this paper indicate that barrier removal projects and mitigation for instream barriers should consider both the magnitude and quality of the lost habitat.},

  abstract = {In rivers supporting Pacific salmon in southeast Alaska, USA, regional trends toward a warmer, wetter climate are predicted to increase mid- and late-21st-century mean annual flood size by 17\% and 28\%, respectively. Increased flood size could alter stream habitats used by Pacific salmon for reproduction, with negative consequences for the substantial economic, cultural, and ecosystem services these fish provide. We combined field measurements and model simulations to estimate the potential influence of future flood disturbance on geomorphic processes controlling the quality and extent of coho, chum, and pink salmon spawning habitat in over 800 southeast Alaska watersheds. Spawning habitat responses varied widely across watersheds and among salmon species. Little variation among watersheds in potential spawning habitat change was explained by predicted increases in mean annual flood size. Watershed response diversity was mediated primarily by topographic controls on stream channel confinement, reach-scale geomorphic associations with spawning habitat preferences, and complexity in the pace and mode of geomorphic channel responses to altered flood size. Potential spawning habitat loss was highest for coho salmon, which spawn over a wide range of geomorphic settings, including steeper, confined stream reaches that are more susceptible to streambed scour during high flows. We estimated that 9\textendash 10\% and 13\textendash 16\% of the spawning habitat for coho salmon could be lost by the 2040s and 2080s, respectively, with losses occurring primarily in confined, higher-gradient streams that provide only moderate-quality habitat. Estimated effects were lower for pink and chum salmon, which primarily spawn in unconfined floodplain streams. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for valley and reach-scale geomorphic features in watershed assessments of climate vulnerability, especially in topographically complex regions. Failure to consider the geomorphic context of stream networks will hamper efforts to understand and mitigate the vulnerability of anadromous fish habitat to climate-induced hydrologic change.},

According to the SDC, dams result in upstream?downstream shifts in biotic and abiotic patterns and processes; the direction and extent of the displacement depend on the variable of interest and are a function of dam position along the river continuum. As originally formulated, the SDC did not consider interactions between the river and its flood plain. The new perspective presented herein is an initial attempt to encompass the dynamics of alluvial flood plain rivers into the model using a three reach characterization: constrained headwater reach, braided reach and meandering reach. The constrained headwater reach has conditions similar to those described in the original SDC, but the braided and meandering reaches provide a perspective that was not addressed in the model. Lateral interactions between the channel and the flood plain are critical to a holistic understanding of natural river ecosystems and the alterations induced by regulation. The fringing flood plain, with its diverse water bodies and alluvial forest mosaic, is considered an integral part of the river system.},

  abstract = {Beaver are an integral component of hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes within North American stream systems, and their propensity to build dams alters stream and riparian structure and function to the benefit of many aquatic and terrestrial species. Recognizing this, beaver relocation efforts and/or application of structures designed to mimic the function of beaver dams are increasingly being utilized as effective and cost-efficient stream and riparian restoration approaches. Despite these verities, the notion that beaver dams negatively impact stream habitat remains common, specifically the assumption that beaver dams increase stream temperatures during summer to the detriment of sensitive biota such as salmonids. In this study, we tracked beaver dam distributions and monitored water temperature throughout 34 km of stream for an eight-year period between 2007 and 2014. During this time the number of natural beaver dams within the study area increased by an order of magnitude, and an additional 4 km of stream were subject to a restoration manipulation that included installing a high-density of Beaver Dam Analog (BDA) structures designed to mimic the function of natural beaver dams. Our observations reveal several mechanisms by which beaver dam development may influence stream temperature regimes; including longitudinal buffering of diel summer temperature extrema at the reach scale due to increased surface water storage, and creation of cool\textemdash water channel scale temperature refugia through enhanced groundwater\textemdash surface water connectivity. Our results suggest that creation of natural and/or artificial beaver dams could be used to mitigate the impact of human induced thermal degradation that may threaten sensitive species.},

  abstract = {``The water runs the river.'' This chapter focuses on the river flow as the fundamental process determining the size, shape, structure, and dynamics of riverine ecosystems. We briefly introduce hydrological regimes as key characteristics of river flow. Hydrological regimes are then linked to habitats and biotic communities. The effects of flow regulation as a result of human activities such as water abstraction (irrigation and hydropower), river channelization, land use, and climate change are demonstrated. Finally, methods to assess the environmental flow, the flow that is needed to maintain the ecological integrity, are described, and examples of successful flow restoration presented.},
